\begin{:section}{title="About the data", name="About"}

This dataset contains information about the average economy-wide emission coverage and price tag associated with carbon pricing mechanisms around the world.
* The coverage data is average economy-wide coverage as a percentage of a jurisdiction's total greenhouse gas emissions.
* The price data is expressed in 2018 USD, using 2018 USD/LCU exchange rates.

We refer to the economy-wide average price as the Emissions-weighted Carbon Price (ECP).

Note that only mechanisms placing an explicit price on CO2 emissions are taken into account. Hence the information presented and underlying data do not reflect the pricing mechanisms that might apply to other greenhouse gases. A few existing mechanisms apply to non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as the EU ETS, which covers some N2O emissions and the Spanish 'carbon' tax, which covers [...].

\begin{:section}{title="Methodology"}

These economy wide averages are based on sector(-fuel) level coverage and price data. This data is available and presented [here](https://gd1989.github.io/WorldCarbonPricingDatabase/).

The methodology and data used to calculate economy-wide averages is described in detail in [Dolphin, G., Pollitt, M. and D.M. Newbery (2020), The Political Economy of Carbon Pricing: a Panel Analysis](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/72/2/472/5530742) as well as on the companion GitHub [repository](https://github.com/gd1989/ECP) to this page. The principle of it is, however, straightforward: it consists in (i) multiplying sector(-fuel) level CO2 emissions share (in total emissions) by their associated price tag and
(ii) aggregate over all sectors (and fuels).
