# Emissions-weighted Carbon Price
 
The Emissions-weighted Carbon Price (ECP) is an economy-wide average price on CO2 emissions. It is calculated from sector-fuel level data, which is aggregated back to the economy level using the share of each sector-fuel CO2 emissions in total GHG emissions as weights.

It is currently calculated for [123] national jurisdictions and 63 (North American) sub-national jurisdictions over the period 1990-2018.

Its calculation requires the combination of information about:
1. Carbon pricing mechanisms' coverage
2. Carbon pricing mechanisms' associated price
3. CO2 emissions from the covered sectors and total GHG emissions

Information about 1. and 2. have been collected as part of a project developed within the Energy Policy Research Group at the University of Cambridge. The full dataset is available (here)[https://github.com/gd1989/WorldCarbonPricingDatabase]. CO2 and GHG emissions data come from various sources. For national jurisdictions, the main sources are the (International Energy Agency's CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion)[https://www.iea.org/reports/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-overview] and the CAIT Country Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data (1990-2016) available on the (Climate Watch platform)[https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions]. For subnational jurisdictions, information is taken from their respective IPCC GHG Inventories.
